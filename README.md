## Problem

In completing this project, I hoped to solve a few problems:
- As a junior developer, how do I make my presence known to potential clients and employers?
- How do I present my website in a way that is succinct and to the point? Websites are evaluated quickly, information should be presented in a way that is easy to evaluate and consume.
- How do I want to be viewed by my audience? What is the best way to market myself to potential clients to achieve this?

## Minimal Viable Product

The MVP for this product would be to at least create a static website that closely resembles my final design in Figma. Beyond that, I will be using flexbox to add responsiveness to my website, and to make all content easily viewable on phone, desktop, and tablet. Finally, I will be using some transitions and keyframes to make my website feel more interactive and dynamic. 

## Research

Research and planning were easily the most important parts of this project for me. Once I had completed both a decided on my final design, coding my website was (besides a couple minor hitches), a fairly straightforward process. 

The first step in my research was to think of themes that would provide inspiration for my color palette. I had a few ideas for this, ranging from the landscape I was surrounded by growing up, calming pastel colors, and bright hues found in city street art. The themes I considered included:

- Country landscape
- Inner city/urban areas (greys mixed with bright, vibrant colors)
- Gardens - both green and drought-resistant (the pastel colors on various cacti provided some great inspiration)
- Minimalist building designs, good use of white space

The tools I used for this stage included:

Pinterest:
I ended up making several Pinterest boards that I could draw inspiration from. I also created boards for different font families, and a Pinterest board solely for logo design. Below is a link to some of the pictures I was drawing inspiration from:

Pastels: 


- Tried pastels - aqua and pinky-brown
- Next tried grey couples with a rainbow of color - too similar
- Next tried vibrant, bold colors, too much
- Settled on original pastels - aqua, pinky brown
- - Began messing around with layout on page
- - Even though colors were soft, didn't want to go overboard with mixing
- - Tried several layouts - some were too busy, two different shades of blue, brown and also neutral white - page looked colorful, but attention was everywhere instead of where it should have been - on my logo and then the content

- Started designing for ipad
- Wanted to add a little texture to full page scroll 0 messing around with gradients
- Looked for design inspiration for gradients

Issue - adding media breakpoints
