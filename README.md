# Personal Portfolio Project

## Research

The initial stages of this project involved a large amount of research. My first step was to think of color themes that would provide inspiration for my color palette. I had a few ideas for this, ranging from the landscape I was surrounded by growing up, calming pastel colors, and bright hues found in city street art. The themes I considered included:

- Country landscape
- Inner city/urban areas (greys mixed with bright, vibrant colors)
- Gardens - both green and drought-resistant (the pastel colors on various cacti provided some great inspiration)
- Minimalist building designs, good use of negative space



The tools I used for this stage included:

Pinterest:
    In my opinion, an essential tool for generating inspiration for designs


- Tried pastels - aqua and pinky-brown
- Next tried grey couples with a rainbow of color - too similar
- Next tried vibrant, bold colors, too much
- Settled on original pastels - aqua, pinky brown
- - Began messing around with layout on page
- - Even though colors were soft, didn't want to go overboard with mixing
- - Tried several layouts - some were too busy, two different shades of blue, brown and also neutral white - page looked colorful, but attention was everywhere instead of where it should have been - on my logo and then the content

- Started designing for ipad
- Wanted to add a little texture to full page scroll 0 messing around with gradients
- Looked for design inspiration for gradients
